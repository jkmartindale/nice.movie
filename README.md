# nice.movie
Intentionally silly design for a bad Human-Computer Interaction course assignment in 2019. We did not get to pick the project and did not get to make layout choices, so color/alignment was pretty much all we could change.

My goal was to create the worst possible color scheme that is somehow still plausible. I think I succeeded.

I can't afford to buy the nice.movie domain but you can still check out the prototype at [nice.movie.jkmartindale.dev](https://nice.movie.jkmartindale.dev).

## Wireframe
Before making the prototype we had to wireframe this website in a cursed application nobody's heard of called [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/). Here's the PNGs of my wireframe, just for fun:
